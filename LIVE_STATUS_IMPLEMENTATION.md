# Live Status Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the live status monitoring feature for the DHStx product page. The feature provides real-time system status updates with automatic refresh capabilities.

## Architecture

### Backend API

The backend API is built with Express.js and provides three main endpoints:

#### Endpoints

1. **GET /api/status/current**
   - Returns current status of all systems
   - Performs health checks on API, Web App, Database, and Authentication services
   - Includes response times, uptime percentages, and overall system status
   - Response format:
     ```json
     {
       "status": "operational",
       "lastUpdated": "2025-10-10T12:00:00.000Z",
       "systems": [
         {
           "name": "API Services",
           "status": "operational",
           "responseTime": "45ms",
           "uptime": "99.99",
           "icon": "Server",
           "lastChecked": "2025-10-10T12:00:00.000Z"
         }
       ],
       "metadata": {
         "serverUptime": 86400,
         "serverLoad": [0.5, 0.6, 0.7],
         "freeMemory": 1073741824,
         "totalMemory": 8589934592
       }
     }
     ```

2. **GET /api/status/uptime**
   - Returns 90-day uptime history
   - Provides monthly breakdown and average uptime
   - Response format:
     ```json
     {
       "period": "90 days",
       "data": [
         { "date": "Jul", "uptime": 99.99 },
         { "date": "Aug", "uptime": 99.98 }
       ],
       "average": "99.99"
     }
     ```

3. **GET /api/status/incidents**
   - Returns incident history with detailed updates
   - Includes status, duration, and timeline of events
   - Response format:
     ```json
     {
       "total": 2,
       "incidents": [
         {
           "id": "INC-001",
           "date": "Oct 1, 2025",
           "title": "Scheduled Maintenance Completed",
           "status": "resolved",
           "duration": "30 minutes",
           "description": "...",
           "impact": "low",
           "updates": [...]
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

### Frontend Implementation

The frontend is built with React and provides a dynamic, real-time status dashboard.

#### Key Features

1. **Real-time Status Display**
   - Shows current status of all systems
   - Color-coded status indicators (green for operational, orange for degraded)
   - Response time and uptime metrics for each service

2. **Auto-refresh**
   - Automatically refreshes status every 30 seconds
   - Can be toggled on/off by the user
   - Visual indicator showing when auto-refresh is active

3. **Manual Refresh**
   - Refresh button to manually update status
   - Shows last updated timestamp with relative time

4. **Visual Indicators**
   - Animated loading state
   - Error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Smooth transitions and hover effects
   - Color-coded status badges

5. **Uptime Visualization**
   - Bar chart showing 90-day uptime history
   - Average uptime calculation
   - Smooth animations on data updates

6. **Incident History**
   - Chronological list of past incidents
   - Detailed timeline for each incident
   - Status and duration information

```

```

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- pnpm >= 8.0.0

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/ubuntu/productpage
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
   
   The `.env` file has been created with the following configuration:
   ```env
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
   VITE_ENV=development
   ```

3. **Start the backend API:**
   ```bash
   pnpm run api:dev
   ```
   
   The API will start on port 3001 by default.

4. **Start the frontend development server:**
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```
   
   The frontend will start on port 5173 by default.

5. **Access the status page:**
   
   Navigate to: http://localhost:5173/status

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Verify API endpoints:**
   ```bash
   # Test current status
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/status/current
   
   # Test uptime history
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/status/uptime
   
   # Test incident history
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/status/incidents
   ```

2. **Test frontend features:**
   - Load the status page and verify all systems display
   - Click the "Refresh" button and verify data updates
   - Toggle "Auto-refresh" on/off and verify behavior
   - Wait 30 seconds with auto-refresh on to verify automatic updates
   - Check responsive design on mobile and desktop

### Integration Testing

The status page integrates with the existing DHStx product page:
- Navigation from header links works correctly
- Footer links are functional
- Design matches the existing DHStx design system
- All animations and transitions are smooth

## Production Deployment

### Environment Configuration

For production deployment, update the `.env.production` file:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://api.dhstx.com
VITE_ENV=production
```

### Build Process

```bash
# Build the frontend
pnpm run build

# The built files will be in the dist/ directory
```

### Backend Deployment

The backend API should be deployed to a production server with:
- Process manager (PM2 recommended)
- Reverse proxy (Nginx recommended)
- SSL/TLS certificates
- Monitoring and logging

### Monitoring Considerations

In production, the status API should be enhanced with:
1. **Real health checks** - Connect to actual services instead of simulated checks
2. **Database integration** - Store historical uptime and incident data
3. **Alert system** - Send notifications when services go down
4. **Rate limiting** - Prevent API abuse
5. **Caching** - Cache status data to reduce load
6. **Authentication** - Protect sensitive endpoints if needed

## Future Enhancements

1. **WebSocket Integration**
   - Real-time push updates instead of polling
   - Instant notification of status changes

2. **Advanced Metrics**
   - CPU and memory usage graphs
   - Request rate and error rate charts
   - Geographic distribution of response times

3. **Subscription System**
   - Email notifications for incidents
   - SMS alerts for critical issues
   - Webhook integrations

4. **Historical Data**
   - Extended uptime history (1 year+)
   - Incident analytics and trends
   - Performance benchmarking

5. **Status Page Customization**
   - Theme customization
   - Custom branding
   - Embeddable status widgets
