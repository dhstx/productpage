## ðŸš€ Remaining Steps

### Step 2: Configure Stripe Webhook (5 minutes)

**What:** Set up Stripe to notify your backend when payments occur

**Steps:**

1. **Get your API endpoint URL**
   - Once deployed, your webhook URL will be: `https://your-domain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
   - For local testing: Use Stripe CLI or ngrok

2. **Configure in Stripe Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
   - Click "Add endpoint"
   - Enter URL: `https://dhstx.co/api/stripe/webhook`
   - Select events to listen for:
     - `checkout.session.completed`
     - `customer.subscription.created`
     - `customer.subscription.updated`
     - `customer.subscription.deleted`
     - `invoice.paid`
     - `invoice.payment_failed`
   - Click "Add endpoint"

3. **Get Webhook Signing Secret**
   - After creating the endpoint, click on it
   - Copy the "Signing secret" (starts with `whsec_...`)
   - Add to your environment variables:
     ```
     STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_secret_here
     ```

4. **Test the webhook**
   - In Stripe Dashboard, click "Send test webhook"
   - Check your API logs to verify it's received

### Step 3: Set Up Google OAuth (10 minutes)

**What:** Enable "Sign in with Google" functionality

**Steps:**

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**
   - Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - Create a new project or select existing one

2. **Enable Google+ API**
   - Go to "APIs & Services" â†’ "Library"
   - Search for "Google+ API"
   - Click "Enable"

3. **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials**
   - Go to "APIs & Services" â†’ "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" â†’ "OAuth client ID"
   - Application type: "Web application"
   - Name: "DHStx Production"
   
4. **Configure OAuth Consent Screen**
   - Add authorized JavaScript origins:
     - `https://dhstx.co`
     - `http://localhost:5173` (for local development)
   - Add authorized redirect URIs:
     - `https://dhstx.co/auth/google/callback`
     - `http://localhost:5173/auth/google/callback`

5. **Get Client ID and Secret**
   - Copy the Client ID
   - Copy the Client Secret
   - Add to environment variables:
     ```
     VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here.apps.googleusercontent.com
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
     ```

6. **Update Frontend**
   - The Google OAuth button is already implemented in `/src/pages/Login.jsx`
   - It will automatically use the `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` from env

### Step 4: Deploy Backend API (10 minutes)

**Option A: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)**

1. **Create `vercel.json` in project root:**
   ```json
   {
     "version": 2,
     "builds": [
       {
         "src": "api/server.js",
         "use": "@vercel/node"
       },
       {
         "src": "package.json",
         "use": "@vercel/static-build",
         "config": {
           "distDir": "dist"
         }
       }
     ],
     "routes": [
       {
         "src": "/api/(.*)",
         "dest": "api/server.js"
       },
       {
         "src": "/(.*)",
         "dest": "/dist/$1"
       }
     ],
     "env": {
       "NODE_ENV": "production"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Add Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/dhstx/productpage/settings/environment-variables
   - Add all variables from `.env.backend`:
     - `SUPABASE_URL`
     - `SUPABASE_KEY`
     - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
     - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
     - `JWT_SECRET`
     - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
     - `JARVIS_API_KEY`
     - `JARVIS_API_URL`

3. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add backend API and deployment config"
   git push origin main
   ```
   - Vercel will automatically deploy

**Option B: Deploy to Railway/Render**

1. **Create account** on Railway.app or Render.com
2. **Connect GitHub repository**
3. **Set environment variables** (same as above)
4. **Deploy** - Platform will auto-detect Node.js app

### Step 5: Update Frontend API URLs

**Update `/src/lib/stripe.js` and API calls:**

```javascript
// Change from localhost to production
const API_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'https://dhstx.co/api';
```

**Add to `.env` file:**
```
VITE_API_URL=https://dhstx.co/api
```
