# Railway Backend Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Code Fixes (COMPLETED)

### Fixed Issues
- [x] **Module Import Errors** - Fixed server.js to import correct files
  - Changed `./agents/chat.js` ‚Üí Created `./routes/chat.js` wrapper for `chat-v3.mjs`
  - Removed `test-chat.js` import (not a route module)
  
- [x] **Route Organization** - Created clean Express router structure
  - `api/routes/chat.js` - Chat endpoint wrapper
  - `api/routes/dashboard.js` - Dashboard statistics
  - `api/routes/billing.js` - Billing history
  - `api/routes/pt.js` - PT usage, estimation, throttle checking
  - `api/routes/subscription.js` - Current subscription details

- [x] **Export Mismatches** - Fixed function import names
  - `check-throttles.js` now uses `getThrottleStatusSummary` instead of non-existent `checkThrottles`

- [x] **Local Testing** - Server starts successfully
  ```
  üöÄ DHStx API Server running on port 3001
  üìç Environment: development
  üîó Frontend URL: http://localhost:5173
  ‚úÖ Server ready to accept connections
  ```

- [x] **Git Commit & Push** - Changes pushed to GitHub
  - Commit: `1b176ac` - "Fix Railway deployment: correct module imports and add route wrappers"
  - Railway will auto-detect and redeploy

## ‚è≥ Phase 2: Railway Deployment (IN PROGRESS)

### Railway Configuration (Already Set)
- [x] Project created: `dhstx-backend-api`
- [x] Connected to GitHub: `dhstx/productpage`
- [x] Root directory: `/api`
- [x] Start command: `npm start` (runs `node server.js`)
- [x] Build command: `npm install`

### Environment Variables (Already Added - 14 total)

**Supabase:**
- [x] `SUPABASE_URL` = `https://zhxkbnmtwqipgavmjymi.supabase.co`
- [x] `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` = `[REDACTED]`
- [x] `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = `[REDACTED]`

**AI APIs:**
- [x] `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` = `[REDACTED]`
- [x] `OPENAI_API_KEY` = `[REDACTED]`

**Stripe:**
- [x] `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = `[REDACTED]`
- [x] `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` = `[REDACTED]`
- [x] `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` = `[REDACTED]`

**Application:**
- [x] `FRONTEND_URL` = `https://dhstx.co`
- [x] `NODE_ENV` = `production`
- [x] `PORT` = `3001` (Railway will override with $PORT)
- [x] `API_PORT` = `3001`
- [x] `JWT_SECRET` = `[REDACTED]`
- [x] `SESSION_SECRET` = `[REDACTED]`

### Expected Deployment Flow
1. ‚úÖ GitHub push detected by Railway
2. ‚è≥ Railway pulls latest code from `main` branch
3. ‚è≥ Railway runs `npm install` in `/api` directory
4. ‚è≥ Railway runs `npm start` (executes `node server.js`)
5. ‚è≥ Server starts on Railway-assigned port
6. ‚è≥ Health check endpoint `/health` responds with 200 OK
7. ‚è≥ Railway assigns public URL (e.g., `https://dhstx-backend-api-production.up.railway.app`)

### Verification Steps (To Do After Deployment)
- [ ] Check Railway deployment logs for successful startup
- [ ] Test health endpoint: `GET https://[railway-url]/health`
- [ ] Test API root: `GET https://[railway-url]/`
- [ ] Verify CORS allows requests from `https://dhstx.co`
- [ ] Test authenticated endpoint (requires valid JWT)
- [ ] Monitor Railway metrics (CPU, memory, response times)

## üîÑ Phase 3: Frontend Integration (NEXT)

### Update Vercel Environment Variables
Once Railway URL is available:
- [ ] Add `VITE_API_URL` = `https://[railway-url]` to Vercel project
- [ ] Redeploy frontend on Vercel to pick up new env var

### Test End-to-End Flow
- [ ] Login at https://dhstx.co
- [ ] Check dashboard loads (calls `/api/dashboard/stats`)
- [ ] Check PT usage displays (calls `/api/pt/usage`)
- [ ] Test AI chat (calls `/api/chat`)
- [ ] Verify billing page (calls `/api/billing/history`)
- [ ] Test subscription management

## üêõ Troubleshooting Guide

### If Deployment Still Fails

**Error: "Cannot find module"**
- Check Railway build logs for exact missing module
- Verify `package.json` includes the dependency
- Ensure `type: "module"` is set for ES modules

**Error: "Port already in use"**
- Railway assigns port via `$PORT` env var
- Server.js already handles this: `process.env.PORT || 3001`

**Error: "supabaseKey is required"**
- Verify `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` is set in Railway env vars
- Check env var name matches exactly (case-sensitive)

**Error: "CORS policy blocked"**
- Verify `FRONTEND_URL` env var is set to `https://dhstx.co`
- Check server.js CORS config includes the frontend URL

**Error: "Health check failed"**
- Railway expects `/health` endpoint to return 200 OK
- Server.js already has this endpoint implemented

### Railway Deployment Logs Location
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Select `dhstx-backend-api` project
3. Click on the service
4. View "Deployments" tab
5. Click on latest deployment
6. View "Build Logs" and "Deploy Logs"

## üìä Expected Deployment Outcome

### Success Indicators
‚úÖ Build completes without errors  
‚úÖ Server starts and logs "Server ready to accept connections"  
‚úÖ Health endpoint returns 200 OK  
‚úÖ Railway assigns public URL  
‚úÖ No crashes or restarts in first 5 minutes  

### Performance Targets
- **Cold start:** < 3 seconds
- **Response time:** < 200ms for health check
- **Memory usage:** < 256 MB idle
- **CPU usage:** < 5% idle

### Cost Estimate
- **Railway Starter Plan:** $5/month (500 hours included)
- **Expected usage:** ~730 hours/month (always-on)
- **Overage cost:** $0.000231/minute = ~$10/month for 24/7
- **Total:** ~$15/month for Railway backend
