## üö® BLOCKERS FOR LAUNCH

**Cannot launch without:**
1. ‚úÖ API Integration - Users must be charged for usage
2. ‚úÖ PT Accounting - Must track and reconcile costs
3. ‚úÖ Legal Pages - Legally required
4. ‚úÖ Security - Cannot expose to public without protection
5. ‚úÖ Webhooks - Must reliably process payments
6. ‚úÖ Observability - Must detect issues
7. ‚úÖ Quality Gates - Must test before deploying

**Can launch without (but should add soon):**
- Conversation Integration (nice to have)
- Email System (can use manual emails initially)
- Team Features (future)
- Workflows (future)
- Integrations (future)

## üí° Key Insights

### What We Built (430 pts)
- ‚úÖ Complete pricing system architecture
- ‚úÖ Database schema and migrations
- ‚úÖ Frontend components and pages
- ‚úÖ Admin monitoring dashboard
- ‚úÖ Referral program
- ‚úÖ Conversation history system

### What We're Missing (225 pts critical)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Connection between chat and PT tracking
- ‚ö†Ô∏è PT ledger and accounting
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal compliance
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Security hardening
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Production monitoring
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Quality assurance

### The Problem
**We built a beautiful house but forgot to connect the plumbing!**

The pricing system exists, but the chat interface isn't using it. Users can chat for free indefinitely because PT tracking isn't connected.
