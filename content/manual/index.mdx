## Start here
Syntek Automations turns **plain-language requests** into **coordinated actions** across your tools, saving hours daily while keeping everything auditable.

> **Why it matters**  
> Teams report multi-hour daily savings once orchestration is wired to Manus Hub and core apps (Notion, GitHub, Vercel, email, calendar) are connected. *This hub becomes your operational control center.* <!-- grounded in internal plan -->

### Popular this week
- “Speak a task, watch it route.”  
- “Auto-summarize meetings to action items.”  
- “Ship a site repo from a template.”

## Walkthroughs
Watch the videos in the Walkthroughs tab to see Manus Hub route requests across Syntek agents and apps.

## How Syntek Works
1. **Capture intent** → A teammate types or records what they need done.
2. **Route to Manus Hub** → The request lands in Manus Hub where context, guardrails, and recent activity are evaluated.
3. **Pick a workflow** → The hub selects the right workflow, or asks for clarification when multiple fit.
4. **Activate agents** → Conductor plans the sequence, Builder assembles artifacts, and Connector handles API actions.
5. **Execute across apps** → GitHub, Vercel, Notion, and other integrations receive scoped actions with approvals when required.
6. **Log the audit trail** → Every step records who approved it, what ran, and where outputs live.

## Common Workflows
- **Ship a site repo** → Scaffold a repo, push to GitHub, deploy to Vercel, then publish the link to Notion or email.
- **Meeting → Action Items** → Ingest a transcript, highlight owners and deadlines, and post updates to the team hub.
- **Lead capture → Outreach** → Collect a form submission, enrich it, and create follow-up tasks in CRM and Slack.

## Security & Auditing
- Enforce least-privilege tokens per connector; rotate or revoke without downtime.
- Require approval gates for sensitive stages (production deploys, data exports, finance actions).
- Stream logs to your SIEM, download exports for audits, and monitor changes via the activity feed.

## Glossary
- **Manus Hub** → The orchestration layer that evaluates context, workflows, and guardrails.
- **Agent** → Specialized automation persona (Conductor, Builder, Connector) that executes a portion of work.
- **Workflow** → A reusable sequence of steps, prompts, and integrations triggered by Manus Hub.
- **Connector** → A scoped integration to an external tool (GitHub, Vercel, Notion, etc.).
- **Approval Gate** → A manual checkpoint that pauses execution until a teammate confirms.
- **Audit Log** → A detailed record of context, prompts, approvals, and results for compliance.
