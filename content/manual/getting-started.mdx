## 1) Connect the essentials (5–10 min)
- Sign in and confirm access to the **Automations Dashboard**.  
- Connect Notion (knowledge), GitHub (code), Vercel (deploy), email + calendar.  
- Optional: Stripe, Read.ai, Taskade, Make.com.

> **Tip**  
> Start with the tools you already live in; expand later.

## 2) Run your first workflow (5 min)
- In the Workflows list, choose **“Create & deploy a starter site”**.
- Say: “Create a repo from template, deploy to Vercel, and post the link to Notion.”

## 3) See it in your data
- Tasks appear in Master Tasks; summaries log to your knowledge base.
- Deploy preview URL is posted to your dashboard for one‑click share.

### Common pitfalls
- Missing API keys block actions; add them in Settings → Integrations.
- If a workflow loops, pause it and check the app credentials.
