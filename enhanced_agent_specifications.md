## 1. System Architecture

### 1.1 Core Principles

The DHStx Agent Ecosystem operates on four foundational principles:

1. **Intelligent Orchestration**: All user interactions flow through the Orchestrator, which analyzes intent and routes to the optimal agent or agent team.
2. **Synergistic Collaboration**: Agents communicate via the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Protocol, enabling complex multi-agent workflows.
3. **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent maintains deep domain expertise while understanding adjacent domains for seamless handoffs.
4. **Continuous Learning**: Agents learn from interactions, improving accuracy and personalization over time.
